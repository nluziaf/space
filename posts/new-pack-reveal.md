# An Introduction to the Pack

So, let's go to the background of why I make this pack first. It was all started with the word "Wow, the concept looks like it's going to be an exciting pack." I was looking back at Draconic Infinity Chapter 1 and 2 and I was like, "What if I combine all tech packs with a bit of realism and design it to be played with friends?" Thus the idea of NLuziaf's SMP Pack was born.

NLuziaf's SMP Pack is a tech modpack with a bit of realism and designed to be played with friends. For now, I can think the pack is supporting 1.18.2 and the pack features Create, Mekanism, and AE2.

## Closing words

I'm gonna give you updates to the pack. Thank you for the time reading this blog, and I hope to see you guys in the next blog, CYA!
